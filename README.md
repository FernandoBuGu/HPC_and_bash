trivariate_dhglm.as: AngelScript file to be run in ASReml (Software for mixed models parameter estimation using 
Residual Maximum Likelihood). It runs a trivariate - double hierarchical generalized linear model 
to estimate variance components for variance-traits, such as Litter size variability.

grill_trivariate_dhglm.as: AngelScript file to be run in ASReml. It runs as GRILL a trivariate - double hierarchical generalized linear model to estimate variance components for variance-traits, such as Litter size variability.
